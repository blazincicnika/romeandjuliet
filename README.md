# Romeo and Juliet

Website project for Dublin Institute of design

A live demo can be found  [HERE](https://blazincicnika.github.io/romeandjuliet/index.html)

## My first webpage

This project is my first attempt to create 
webpage.

## UX

My goal was to make it simple as possible but still in a modern look

## Technologies
1.  HTML
2.  CSS
3.  Bootstrap
4.  Font Awesome - Icons

## Features

This site uses: 
Bootstrap Navbar - it's a nice effect when the user checks the website with mobile or tablet screen size. It turns Navbar into a "hamburger"

Bootstrap cards - also nice effect for pricing ticket list with added button to buy a ticket. It's responsive and mobile frendly 

## Testing

This site was tested with multiple browsers and devices.

There are still some bugs to fix to make it more mobile-friendly
